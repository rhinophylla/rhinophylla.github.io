### Data Science

- [Analysis of posts to r/progresspics](https://github.com/rhinophylla/r_progesspics)

  r/progresspics is a weight change forum where post titles contain demographic information about the users. From the post 
  titles, I extracted features such as sex, age, height, starting weight, and ending weight as well as the duration of weight
  change. I used a linear regression analysis to see if variability in the amount of weight loss could be explained by any
  of the extracted features.  A second linear regression analysis looked to see if variability in post popularity could be
  explained by the extracted features or by additional features describing the posts themselves.  
  
- [BiologyFinder](https://github.com/rhinophylla/BiologyFinder)

  BiologyFinder is a tool aimed at new biology graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who have just joined a lab and
  are looking to understand the research of the lab. It is written in Python and relies on the Python library, Biopython, to
  interact with the API of NCBI's PubMed, a biology literature database. It uses a shared citation history to identify
  biologists doing work similar to a user-named biologist. It then generates a recommended reading list containing the papers
  most frequently cited by the identified group of biologists in the subfield.

  Return to your childhood with a round of Crazy Eights.  It is you versus the computer as opposed to you versus grandma!
