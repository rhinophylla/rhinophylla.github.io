### Data Science

- [Analysis of posts to r/progresspics](https://github.com/rhinophylla/r_progesspics)

  r/progresspics is a weight change forum where post titles contain demographic information about the users. From the post 
  titles I extracted features such as sex, age, height, starting weight, and ending weight as well as the duration of weight
  change. I used a linear regression analysis to see if variability in the amount of weight lost could be explained by any
  of the extracted features.  A second linear regression analysis looked to see if variablity in post popularity could be
  explained by the extracted features or by additional features describing the posts themselves.

  Return to your childhood with a round of Crazy Eights.  It is you versus the computer as opposed to you versus grandma!
